<p style="padding-left:20px; font-size:18px;">Web development was something I never imagined myself doing — until I started.</p>

<h1 style="padding-left:20px;">The Beginning</h1>

<p style="padding-left:20px; font-size:18px;">It all began with curiosity. I was fascinated by how websites worked and looked. So I opened a text editor and <br>
typed my first HTML tag.</p>
<h1 style="padding-left:20px;">What I Learned</h1>

<p style="padding-left:20px; font-size:18px;">From basic HTML and CSS to more advanced topics like JavaScript and React, every step opened up new <br> possibilities. I started building small projects, and soon I was contributing to real websites..</p>
