  <h1>How I Started Learning Web Development</h1>
  <time datetime="2025-06-01">June 1, 2025</time>

  <p>Web development was something I never imagined myself doing — until I started.</p>

  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>It all began with curiosity. I was fascinated by how websites worked and looked. So I opened a text editor and typed my first HTML tag.</p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>From basic HTML and CSS to more advanced topics like JavaScript and React, every step opened up new possibilities. I started building small projects, and soon I was contributing to real websites.</p>
